**Debugging** is the process of **identifying and fixing errors** (bugs) in a computer program. When writing code, errors may occur that prevent the program from functioning properly. Debugging involves locating and resolving these issues.

Python is a simple, readable, and versatile programming language used to create applications in various fields such as web development, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and automation.

The debugging process includes:
1. **Analyzing errors**: Understanding the error message and where it occurs in the code.
2. **Isolating the problem**: Testing specific parts of the code to pinpoint the error.
3. **Fixing the issue**: Modifying the code to resolve the problem.
4. **Retesting**: Ensuring the error is fixed and the program works as expected.

Tools like the **pdb** debugger in Python, **logging** messages, and IDEs help streamline the debugging process.
